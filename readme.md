This year's Advent of Code story was about exploring a deep ocean trench in a mini-submarine and solving problems with the instruments and navigation as you diver deeper and deeper.

This year I decided to break from my JavaScript day-to-day and attempt every puzzle using **Python**:

 - I practiced a lot of data manipulation in Python.
 - Learned how to use *List Comprehensions* where I would usually reach for JavaScript `Array.prototype.map()`
 - Understood that I had to import `reduce` rather than relying on it just being there as in JavaScript.
 - Noted the differences between `copy` and `deepcopy`.
 - Used a *Lambda function* or two which <em>feel</em> a lot like JavaScript Arrow Functions.
 - Figured out basic *unit-testing*. As Python's `unittest` is readily importable this was much nicer than the JavaScript experience of having to decide which of many test runners to choose.
 - Used *type hinting* to tighten the feedack loop of errors and warnings.
 - Setting up VSCode for Python work and utilising the built in debugger.

I managed a score of *21\**. A little better than last year. Looking forward to completing every star one year ðŸ’ª.

## Unit testing

Python version `3.10.0`
